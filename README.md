# Oilopedia-Website

1 Introduction
Cooking oil is one of the most essential ingredients for our health. If our cooking oil is not good then
it brings an unpleasant taste to our food and causes some health issue. Since there is a huge demand
for cooking oil in India, “Oilopedia” is planning to sell quality cooking oil to the consumer like
coconut oil, walnut oil, sunflower seed oil, and many more. We will collect the quality oil seeds from
the farmers and extract the oil from the seeds and then sell the quality cooking oil to the consumer’s
doorsteps. Our Main Objective is to sell quality cooking oil and would like to showcase more
information about the oils like medicinal uses and magnificence of the oils on our website.
The E-Commerce website must be responsive and also need to take minimum time to load which is our first
priority. We have added the best pictures to our website which will give a better experience for the
customers. Another important thing is online payment, so we designed it in such a way that it will
be smooth and secure. On the whole, we ensure that the customer will have a better experience while
using this website.
